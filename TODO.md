- include a running total on each table
- write acceptance tests
- log all actions
- lint code
- refactor the code so that a more general form of reading is accepted
- soft-code the schemas
  - We are only limited to energy consumption readings. However, in the future, we will have many other different types of readings.
  - Have them all be a part of the same tables, but with a flag that indicates what kind of a reading it is
- rename the `models` folder to `db`, and move all model classes to `db/models`
- document the source code. Maybe using JavaDoc for JavaScript. YUIDoc seems promising
- require a password to change ownership
